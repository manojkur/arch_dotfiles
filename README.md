# dotfiles
## Automatic Setup
To automatically setup the dotfiles run from anywhere:
```
./setup.sh
```
This will keep the old configuration files around with a '.old' suffix

**Options:**  
-d -- Don't keep '.old' files around; i.e. completely overwrite

### Sets up config for:
* bash
* zsh
* vim
* tmux
* ranger
* termite
* zathura
